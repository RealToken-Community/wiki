# Introduction

This Wiki is created and managed by the volunteer Community of [RealT](https://realt.co/) investors.  
On the occasion of the launch of the RealToken DAO, this new Wiki complements the [existing one](https://community-realt.gitbook.io/tuto-community) (with another solution: Wiki.js vs Gitbook). It is set up to test a solution that should offer more flexibility and contribution possibilities for the entire community.  
The first articles therefore concern the DAO and are produced here as a test. If this proves conclusive, other topics will follow...  
Enjoy reading and thank you for your feedback and contributions.
