<p>This chapter brings together the main developments of the DAO, for people who are a little far from the subject or who do not have much time to follow the many messages on the communication channels on a daily basis. The information is summarized, through the following articles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How the DAO is structured through its decisions and its organization,</li>
  <li>The evolution of the REG governance token,</li>
  <li>The variation of your voting power,</li>
  <li>The rewards you can earn by voting,</li>
  <li>The multiple means of communication of the DAO (in 4 languages).</li>
  <li>As well as a glossary, terms a little specific to our community.</li>
</ul>
