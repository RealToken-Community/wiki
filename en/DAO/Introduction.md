## **1.1. What is a DAO?**
<br>

<br>

#### **⭐ For beginners**

A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is like an online club (on the blockchain) where members make decisions together. Imagine a WhatsApp group where everyone can propose ideas and vote, but with clear, transparent, and automated rules.

#### **⭐⭐ For the initiated**

A DAO is an organizational structure based on blockchain, where governance rules are encoded in smart contracts. It allows for collective and transparent decision-making, without a central authority, to evolve protocols, projects, and allows participation from anyone without discrimination, as long as they respect the common rules of the DAO.

#### **⭐⭐⭐ For experts**

A DAO represents a significant evolution in organizational governance, using blockchain technology and smart contracts to create decentralized and autonomous decision-making systems to manage treasury flows, assets, ecosystem smart contracts, and operational parameters. Key features include:

-   On-chain governance: All decisions and actions are immutably recorded on the blockchain,
-   Smart contracts: Operating rules are coded and automatically executed,
-   Tokenization: Voting rights and participation are typically linked to the possession of specific tokens,
-   Consensus mechanisms: Various voting and proposal models ensure collective decision-making,
-   Decentralized treasury: DAO assets are managed transparently and programmably.

## **1.2. Why DAOs are important in the blockchain ecosystem**

#### **⭐ For beginners**

DAOs are important because they allow people from all over the world to work together on projects, make decisions, and manage money, all in a fair and transparent manner. Every actor is equal regardless of their geographic region, race, gender, etc. It's as if the Internet had its own way of creating businesses and organizations. DAOs therefore allow managing all aspects of a project, product, organization, etc. in a decentralized, transparent, fair manner without having to trust other participants, thus playing a mediator role between all actors in the ecosystem.

#### **⭐⭐ For the initiated**

DAOs play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem as they embody the principles of decentralization and disintermediation. They offer a new governance model that allows:

-   Direct user participation in project management,
-   Increased transparency in decision-making,
-   Reduction of costs related to traditional intermediaries,
-   Increased flexibility and adaptability to market changes.

DAOs, by their design, help solve trust issues in one or more actors to maintain a healthy and sustainable ecosystem. A dynamic DAO thus allows for the perpetuation of an ecosystem's existence in case of disappearance of one or more major actors, and provides opportunities for anyone willing to invest and make skills available.

The control of Smart Contracts by the DAO ensures transparency on the operating parameters of Smart Contracts and updates, thus a single actor cannot modify the parameters of Smart Contracts without the consensus of the DAO.

Ecosystem users therefore have visibility and control over Smart Contract parameters, which gives them confidence in the ecosystem without having to trust a particular actor.

#### **⭐⭐⭐ For experts**

DAOs represent a fundamental innovation in the blockchain ecosystem for several reasons:

-   Decentralized governance: They allow for true decentralization of decision-making power, thus aligning governance with the fundamental principles of blockchain, bringing together ecosystem actors from around the world. This diversity allows for multiple viewpoints and more holistic problem-solving.
-   Economic efficiency: By reducing frictions and costs associated with traditional hierarchical structures and companies, DAOs can potentially achieve superior operational efficiency and redistribute part of the benefits directly to participants.
-   Aligned incentives: Tokenization mechanisms allow aligning participants' interests with those of the organization, creating a more coherent and motivating ecosystem.
-   Open innovation: DAOs facilitate large-scale collaboration, enabling the emergence of new models of innovation and value creation. Multiple viewpoints and different needs allow for the emergence of new revolutionary ideas and products.
-   Autonomy and resilience: The programmable and self-executing nature of DAOs makes them more resistant to external interventions and individual failures, making them more reliable and robust.
-   Interoperability: DAOs can interact natively with other blockchain protocols, paving the way for complex and interconnected ecosystems.
-   Dynamic governance: DAOs can evolve and adapt based on needs, opportunities, and threats, allowing for rapid response to changes and needs of ecosystem users.
-   Global governance: DAOs can manage resources and activities on a global scale, allowing for global coordination and efficient response of ecosystem resources to propose solutions and guarantees within the ecosystem.

## **1.3. Advantages and challenges of DAOs**

#### **⭐ For beginners**

Advantages:

-   Open participation to all, without discrimination,
-   Decisions made collectively,
-   Total transparency of actions and finances.

Challenges:

-   Understanding the technical functioning,
