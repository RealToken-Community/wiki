<p>For your first steps with the Wiki editors and adding images...</p>
<h2>With Visual Editor</h2>
<p>A very intuitive solution, where everything is done from the editing bar:</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:77.74%;"><img src="/tuto/tuto8.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>With Markdown</h2>
<p>A bit more complex, as you need to know the syntax.<br>You write on the left side of the screen in markdown format, and the result appears on the right.<br>You also have an editing bar here to help you with the most common syntaxes.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:80.76%;"><img src="/tuto/tuto9.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding images</h2>
<p>In each of the editors, you have the option to add images (or documents to download).</p>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:47.53%;"><img src="/tuto/tuto10.png"></figure>
<p>Once you've clicked on the image add icon in your page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you will first need to upload your image to a folder:<ul>
      <li>choose or create the corresponding folder (in the correct language!),</li>
      <li>at the top right, with "<i>Browse...</i>", find your image in your PC folders,</li>
      <li>then click "<i>Upload</i>", your image will appear in the folder you selected on the left,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select your image from the list on the left, Select an alignment mode for your image on the page (bottom right), then click "<i>Insert</i>",</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You then return to the editor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Markdown, the following code is inserted into the page (if you chose the center alignment option for the image)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>![myimage.png](/tuto/myimage.png){.align-center}</code><br>To resize the image, you'll need to manually add the following tag: for example, to reduce to 75% of the original size<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<code>![myimage.png](/tuto/myimage.png){.img75 .align-center}</code></li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/tuto/tuto11.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>With Visual Editor, the image appears on the page (where your cursor was when you added it).<br>By clicking on the image, it's framed in blue, you can then:<ul>
      <li>resize it by moving one of its corners,</li>
      <li>modify the framing on the page, via the menu that appears at the top.<br>(except for the centering option which doesn't work)<br>You can thus insert text next to the image, as you can see in this tutorial.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
