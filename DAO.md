# Table of Contents of the DAO REG Documentation

## Preamble

The document is intended for both experienced DAOs and those who are less experienced. This document is written with a multi-level approach, so that everyone can find useful information in it. Newbies can stick to the 1-star (**⭐**) sections, which popularize and simplify the concepts explained in more detail in the 3-star (**⭐⭐⭐**) sections. For people with a background in DeFi and DAOs, the 1- and 2-star sections will allow them to better understand the context and overall mechanisms. People experienced with DAOs can skip the 1- and 2-star sections and focus on the 3-star section.
