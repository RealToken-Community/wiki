# Table of contents of the REG DAO documentation

## Preamble

The document is intended for people experienced with DAOs, as well as those who are less so. This document is written with a multi-level approach, so that everyone can find useful information. Novices can content themselves with the one-star (**⭐**) parts that vulgarize and simplify the concepts explained in more detail in the three-star (**⭐⭐⭐**) parts. For people with a background in DeFi and DAOs, the one and two-star parts will help them better understand the context and overall mechanisms. People experienced with DAOs can skip the one and two-star parts and focus on the three-star part.
