## Introduction

This Wiki is created and managed by the volunteer Community of [RealT](https://realt.co/) investors. It was created on the occasion of the launch of the RealToken DAO to complement the existing documentation and offer more flexibility and contribution possibilities to the entire community.

## Objective

The main objective of this Wiki is to test a solution (Wiki.js) that should offer more flexibility and contribution possibilities for the entire community compared to the existing solution (Gitbook).

## Content

Currently, the Wiki mainly focuses on the RealToken DAO. The first articles therefore concern the DAO and are created here as a test. If this approach proves conclusive, other topics will follow.

## How to contribute

1. Carefully read the existing content,
2. Propose modifications or additions via the Wiki or Github,
3. Participate in discussions on existing articles,
4. Suggest new topics to cover.
