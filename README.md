# Wiki-js

## Introduction

This project is a Wiki created and managed by the volunteer Community of [RealT](https://realt.co/) investors. It was created on the occasion of the launch of the RealToken DAO to complement the existing documentation and offer more flexibility and contribution possibilities to the entire community.

## Objective

The main objective of this Wiki is to test a solution (Wiki.js) that should offer more flexibility and contribution possibilities for the entire community compared to the existing solution (Gitbook).

## Content

Currently, the Wiki mainly focuses on the RealToken DAO. The first articles therefore concern the DAO and are created here as a test. If this approach proves successful, other topics will follow.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several language folders, with a similar structure for each language:

- `/fr`: French content
- `/es`: Spanish content
- `/pt`: Portuguese content
- `/`: English content (default language)

Each language folder contains:

- A `home.md` file that serves as the Wiki's homepage,
- A `DAO.md` file for specific DAO information,
- A `Tuto.md` file for initiating Wiki contributors,
- An `notes_Admin.html` file for specific Wiki Admin notes,
- A folder for each topic:
  - `DAO` containing pages related to the RealToken DAO,
  - `Tuto` containing help pages for Wiki contributors
- An `assets` folder containing images and other resources used in the Wiki.
- A `documents` folder containing PDF documents and others linked to Wiki pages.
