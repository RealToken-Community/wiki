# 6. Future Perspectives

## 6.1. Planned evolutions of the DAO

#### ⭐ For beginners

The RealToken DAO will continue to develop and improve over time. Here's what you can expect (the order of the following points does not represent the order of development):

1. V1: Simple and effective governance, which aims to initiate basic concepts,
2. Evolution of possibilities to participate in decisions,
3. New ways to use your REG tokens forcing holders to make usage choices,
4. Better integration with other blockchain services,
5. Easier-to-use tools for voting and making proposals,
6. Delegation of voting power to become a delegate or to delegate your votes,
7. New applications related to NFTs,
8. New applications for the use of RealTokens, such as a DEX, YAM v2, RMMv4, and other applications.

#### ⭐⭐ For the initiated

Planned evolutions for the RealToken DAO include (the order of the following points does not represent the order of development):

1. V1: Progressive deployment of v1 governance with features released progressively,
2. V1: Progressive increase in the scope of action,
3. V1: Testing and adjustment of governance processes,
4. V1: Decisions on various v1 governance parameters and first DApps,
5. V2: Transition to Phase 2 with the integration of NFTs in governance,
6. New use cases for REG in the RealToken ecosystem, these new use cases will involve having to lock REGs for a duration in a specific contract of the DApp,
7. YAM v2, will bring more flexibility with new features,
8. RMM v4, rethinks the functioning of liquidity to allow better yields for deposits and decrease the cost for borrowers, bringing more stability in interest rates and opening the way to new use cases,
9. DEX v1, a DEX entirely designed for the ecosystem, it will allow pooling liquidity to make RealTokens more liquid,
10. Improved user experience to simplify liquidity aggregation between DEX, YAM and buyback by token issuers, creation of a user interface linking all liquidity sources and finding the best price to buy back and sell RealTokens,
11. NFT Marketplace, a marketplace for Cityzen, Activity, and Collector NFTs,
12. Implementation of various mechanisms to generate yields for the DAO (RMMv4, YAM, DEX, NFT Marketplace, etc...).

#### ⭐⭐⭐ For experts

The evolution perspectives of the RealToken DAO are multiple (the order of the following points does not represent the order of development):

Governance V1:

- Implementation of governance processes,
- Determination of governance decentralization thresholds,
- Testing and adjustments of governance mechanisms to find the best balance and parameters to guarantee governance security and its decentralization,
- Activate and configure incentive epochs,
- Vote on the first projects under DAO control,
- Vote on the first DAO budgets.

NFT Integration (governance v2):

- Deployment of Citizen, Activity, and Collector NFTs,
- Development of new v2 governance contracts,
- Development of v2 governance interface,
- Deployment of an NFT marketplace for Citizen, Activity, and Collector,
- Implementation of voting power calculation tools and decisions on various parameters for NFTs,
- Vote for the first incentive epochs in REG for NFTs,

DeFi Expansion:

- Deployment of YAM v2, will bring more flexibility and new features, REGs could give an advantage on YAM v2 such as fee reductions, longer listing time for announcements, priority access to announcements,
- Deployment of DEX v1, a DEX entirely designed for the ecosystem, it will allow pooling liquidity to make RealTokens more liquid, liquidity will be concentrated, without slippage, swap fees will be calculated by tranches of liquidity use dynamically adjusting swap fees, liquidity could also benefit from interest generated by RMM v4, liquidity provision made only in stable coin,
- Development of RMM v4, it will allow obtaining more stability in interest rates and reduce the cost for borrowers, opening the way to new use cases, should be an important engine in generating cash flow for the DAO, REG will play an important role in RMM v4 to unlock additional features, increase your yield, decrease borrowing cost, increase LTV tiers, increase maximum borrowable, etc...

These evolutions aim to create a complete and powerful DeFi ecosystem while offering more value and flexibility to REG holders.

Future uses of REG will not be limited to voting rights only, in all cases REGs will give a voting right unless decided otherwise by the DAO, however to benefit from advantages in a DApp, holders will have to lock REGs in this DApp, this means that a REG gives a voting right (variable power) + an advantage in a particular application, this forces holders to make choices on the use of their REGs, encourage more thoughtful and active participation, increasing engagement with obtaining new advantages.
