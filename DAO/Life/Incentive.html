<p>The reward program consists of distributing Bonuses (in stablecoin), for wallets that block REG in the Incentive Vault and that vote during the incentive epoch. The application to block REG and collect Bonuses: &nbsp;<a href="https://vote.realtoken.network/dao/incentive">link</a></p>
<p>The amount of Bonus awarded is proportional to the number of votes executed and the number of REG blocked during the epoch.&nbsp;<br>Epochs may not be successive, they are decided by the DAO (ex RIP00001 for epoch 1).</p>
<h1>Epoch 1</h1>
<p>Its main features were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Epoch (session) start: November 9th 0h</li>
  <li>REG deposit period end: November 14th 0h</li>
  <li>Epoch 1 end (and REG lock): December 26th 0h</li>
  <li>Total epoch Bonus amount: 6000 USDC</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 160K REG were deposited. 8 votes took place during this epoch (RIP 0002 to 00009). The annualized APR for having made the 8 votes is approximately 24%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of this first epoch, it is possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>either to simply claim your Bonuses (e.g. to reinvest them in REG..), and leave all or part of the REG in the vault for the next epoch,</li>
  <li>or to withdraw all or part of the deposited REGs (all the Bonuses being claimed on this occasion).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Epoch 2</h1>
<p>With similar characteristics to Epoch 1, it took place from March 10 to April 26, 2025.</p>
