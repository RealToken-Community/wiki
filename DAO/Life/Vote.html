<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>The DAO is managed by RealT for its beginnings. A proposal (Authority framework) specifies the scope of responsibility of RealT and the principle of the progressive transfer to the DAO: vote to come. The decentralization of responsibilities (currently handled by RealT) has already begun, through elections of members for specific missions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proposer<br>To help establish: proposals on the Forum and corresponding votes on Tally (onChain). Proposal in principle voted (RIP00005), Application and election: in progress</li>
  <li>Security Committee<br>To ensure the security of the DAO protocols (at a minimum, intervene urgently to stop a protocol). Proposal in principle voted (RIP00006). Mode of operation and election: ongoing</li>
  <li>Working group for the establishment of Voting Powers<br>To study and propose the next version of the algorithm that calculates Voting Power from the REG held.Proposal in principle voted (RIP00007). Application and election: ongoing</li>
  <li>Liquidity Management Committee<br>On the occasion of RIP00003 (creation of a Sushiswap v3 pool) the principle of a committee for the management of positions was voted. Its election will be the subject of a future proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions, currently carried out by RealT on RMM, will now be decided by the DAO (RIP00008).<br>&nbsp;</p>
