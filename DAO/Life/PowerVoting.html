<p>Voting power is established from the REGs owned, regardless of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the way they are owned: on its Wallet, deposited on a Liquidity Pool or deposited on the Incentive Vault,</li>
  <li>the blockchain used (Gnosis, Polygon or Ethereum).</li>
</ul>
<p>At an unpredictable date (so that there is no manipulation), RealT takes a snapshot to collect the situation of all the REGs. From this collection, a program (offChain) calculates the Voting Power of each. This is a weighting of the mode of use of the REGs (and the counterparts in the liquidity pools) which is decided by the DAO.</p>
<p>The quantity of Voting Power token of each remains unchanged, until the next snapshot (even if the quantity of REG has moved in the meantime). This token is non-transferable. The quantity of Voting Power of a wallet is visible on the application <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/realtoken-ecosystem-governance">Tally</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://gnosisscan.io/token/0x6382856a731Af535CA6aea8D364FCE67457da438#balances"> explorer.</a></p>
<h1>Weighting algorithm</h1>
<p>The first snapshots used the following weighting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 REG in a Wallet or the Incentive Vault is worth 1 PowerVoting</li>
  <li>1 REG in a liquidity pool is worth 1.2 PowerVoting,</li>
  <li>The stablecoins brought in return in the Liquidity Pool are worth 0.5 PowerVoting of the REG equivalent</li>
</ul>
<p>This algorithm was established by RealT.&nbsp;<br>A dedicated Committee will be formed to prepare and vote on the next versions of the algorithm (RIP00007).&nbsp;<br>The corresponding calculation program will soon be made public.</p>
<p>The program, created by RealT, for the snapshot and calculation is available: <a href="https://github.com/real-token/balance-calculator">Github</a></p>
<h1>Snapshot</h1>
<p>For each snapshot, RealT generates two types of files (in csv and json format):</p>
<ul>
  <li>balancesREG: Lists all wallets that have REG, with the quantity for each mode of use,</li>
  <li>powerVotingREG_balances: List of wallets that have PowerVoting with the quantity resulting from the calculation by the algorithm. The following addresses are excluded from this second list (because they cannot vote): Liquidity Pools, Incentive Vaults, Safes that manage the DAO budgets, and the allocation to Mt Pelerin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Snapshot dates:</p>

  <li>October 29,</li>
  <li>November 14,</li>
