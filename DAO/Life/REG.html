<h1>Creation of REGs</h1>
<p>The DAO governance tokens (RealToken Ecosystem Governance, REG) are created at two times:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the DAO is created (2024), for a fixed quantity of 500 million and divided into 8 budgets.</li>
  <li>During the first revaluation of a Realtoken:<ul>
      <li>USDREG ($ convertible to REG) is allocated to holders of the revalued Realtoken.</li>
      <li>These USDREG are convertible into REG, which is created at that time (this is the "inflation" of the REG quantity).</li>
      <li>Before the emergence of USDREG and the conversion application, SOON tokens were distributed. They have since disappeared.</li>
      <li>For more details: <a href="/en/DAO/Life/ClaimREG">link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The quantity of REG may increase or decrease, depending on the decisions of the DAO.</p>

<p>Summary of allocations &nbsp;: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBAM_FPDIovqru-bhhKRvZm_Y6GGC4eUkk1v9ieqAHY/edit?usp=sharing">Spreadsheet</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Detailed description in the <a href="https://wiki.realtoken.community/en/DAO/Life/Com">Whitepaper</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The REG is available on three blockchains: <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/token/0x0aa1e96d2a46ec6beb2923de1e61addf5f5f1dce">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0AA1e96D2a46Ec6beB2923dE1E61Addf5F5f1dce">Ethereum</a> et <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x0AA1e96D2a46Ec6beB2923dE1E61Addf5F5f1dce">Polygon</a><br>RealT has implemented an application to bridge REGs (<a href="https://bridge.realtoken.network/">link</a>) from one blockchain to another. When a REG is bid, it is destroyed (burn) from the original chain and created (mint) on the target chain.<br>&nbsp;There is also this application that bridges CCIP compatible tokens : <a href="https://app.transporter.io/?from=xdai&amp;tab=token&amp;to=polygon&amp;token=REG">link</a><br><br>The amount of REG on each blockchain is currently (end of 2024):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gnosis chain : 499,999,793<strong>.</strong>99</li>
  <li>Ethereum : 1</li>
  <li>Polygon : 205,01</li>
</ul>
<p>That is 500 million in total.</p>
<h1>First Distribution (Airdrop Genesis)</h1>
<p>All RealT client wallets (KYC) could request, during the month of May 2024, 100 REG for free per wallet.&nbsp;<br>The objective of this distribution was to establish a first price level of REG.&nbsp;<br>2,061,500 REG were minted on this occasion and deposited in a <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xa99302f22f646c075413c69f2565fe69b5f5829a">Vault.</a><br>769,200 REG were claimed (37%), on the corresponding application, during the distribution month.&nbsp;<br>The price was set at just under $1.&nbsp;<br>This airdrop being taken from the DAO Treasury budget, the 1,298,600 unclaimed REG were transferred to the Treasury Safe wallet (10/23/2024).</p>
<h1>Purchase / Sale of REG</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With other tokens, via Liquidity Pools or YAM.</h3>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">The easiest way to buy or sell REG</mark>, at the best price on the pools, is to use the 1inch aggregator: &nbsp;<a href="https://app.1inch.io/#/100/advanced/swap/USDC/REG">https://app.1inch.io/#/100/advanced/swap/USDC/REG</a>.</p>
<p>Many liquidity pools with REG have been created, they are visible on applications like <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">Dextools</a> (search with the REG address: 0x0aa1e96d2a46ec6beb2923de1e61addf5f5f1dce).&nbsp;<br>The types of pool are very diverse (Honeyswap, Sushiswap, Balancer, Algebra, ..) and the exchange can be done with many tokens (USDC, WXDAI, RWA, BORG, EURe, ..)</p>
<p>To improve the liquidity of the REG, the DAO creates a pool on Sushiswap v3 (REG / USDC) with an endowment of 200 K REG, on several parity levels (RIP00003). The safe wallet that holds the liquidity is the following : <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x0212B941Cb5c80c9FcDA00035D126Ac067169E72#tokentxns">link</a><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With fiat currencies</h3>
<p>The purchase of REG, with fiat currencies, will soon be available via the services of <a href="https://www.mtpelerin.com">Mt Pelerin </a>(RIP00010).<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Value of REG</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:32.7%;"><img src="/imag-en/valeur_reg_avril_2025_.png"></figure>
<p><br>The value of REG can be seen on apps like CoinGecko:<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/realtoken-ecosystem-governance"> link</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/fr/pi%C3%A8ces/realtoken-ecosystem-governance">https://www.coingecko.com/fr/pi%C3%A8ces/realtoken-ecosystem-governance</a><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>The value of the REG:</p>
<ul>
  <li>appreciated after the presentation of the first version of the governance tools (October 2024),</li>
  <li>depreciated following the conversion of Soon to REG, given the lack of market liquidity (March 2025)<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>DAO Treasury</h1>

<p>The total of these movements corresponds to the 50.134 million REG displayed.</p>
<h3><br>RMM Deposit Token (armmV3..)</h3>
<p><br>RMM deposit tokens come from the revenue generated by RMM v3 ((visible on the <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x586B572EDF0916D2aFEa1f909B1ff8D8eC8a4210#tokentxns">collector contract&nbsp;</a>)</p>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:69.58%;"><img src="/imag-en/retraits_rmm.png"></figure>
<p><br>charges 10% fees on the interest on loans (in USDC and WXDAI). These fees are shared between: AAVE (the basis of the RMM application) for 20%; and the DAO for 80%.</p>
<p>The DAO share is received on the Treasury in RMM deposit tokens (so they grow, as long as they are not converted to stablecoin).&nbsp;<br><br>In 2024, they were collected (from RMM to the Treasury) twice in October and December.Collection is done by RealT when necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complementary movements took place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>November 2024:<ul>
      <li>armmv3 USDC was converted to USDC to fund the 6,000 USDC of the first incentive epoch (RIP00001),</li>
      <li>The DAO treasury received the amount raised (and accrued) by a first pre-DAO initiative in 2022 (SGOV).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>March 2025:&nbsp;<br>armmv3 WXDAI was converted to WXDAI to fund the 6,000 WXDAI of the second incentive epoch (RIP00017).</li>
  <li>August 2025 : Fees Collect from RMM (with <a href="https://wiki.realtoken.community/en/dapp-ecosystem/ClaimFeeRMM">new tools</a> builded for DAO)</li>
