<h1>Creation of REGs</h1>
<p>The DAO governance tokens (RealToken Ecosystem Governance, REG) are created at two times:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the DAO is created (2024), for a fixed quantity of 500 million and divided into 8 budgets.</li>
  <li>During the first revaluation of a Realtoken:<ul>
      <li>Before the creation of the REG, SOON tokens (*) were created, which will soon be convertible into REG.</li>
      <li>Once the Soon have disappeared, the REG will be created and allocated to the owner of the Realtoken at the time of its first revaluation. The distribution will be done in accordance with the voted procedure (RIP00009).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The quantity of REG may increase or decrease, depending on the decisions of the DAO.</p>
<p>(*): Quantity and holders of Soon (non-transferable token, unlike the REG) : <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/token/0xaa2c0cf54cb418eb24e7e09053b82c875c68bb88#balances">link</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary of allocations &nbsp;: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBAM_FPDIovqru-bhhKRvZm_Y6GGC4eUkk1v9ieqAHY/edit?usp=sharing">Spreadsheet</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Detailed description in the <a href="https://wiki.realtoken.community/en/DAO/Life/Com">Whitepaper</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The REG is available on three blockchains: <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/token/0x0aa1e96d2a46ec6beb2923de1e61addf5f5f1dce">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0AA1e96D2a46Ec6beB2923dE1E61Addf5F5f1dce">Ethereum</a> et <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x0AA1e96D2a46Ec6beB2923dE1E61Addf5F5f1dce">Polygon</a><br>RealT has implemented an application to bridge REGs (<a href="https://bridge.realtoken.network/">link</a>) from one blockchain to another. When a REG is bid, it is destroyed (burn) from the original chain and created (mint) on the target chain.<br>&nbsp;There is also this application that bridges CCIP compatible tokens : <a href="https://app.transporter.io/?from=xdai&amp;tab=token&amp;to=polygon&amp;token=REG">link</a><br><br>The amount of REG on each blockchain is currently (end of 2024):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gnosis chain : 499,999,793<strong>.</strong>99</li>
  <li>Ethereum : 1</li>
  <li>Polygon : 205,01</li>
</ul>
<p>That is 500 million in total.</p>
<h1>First Distribution (Airdrop Genesis)</h1>
<p>All RealT client wallets (KYC) could request, during the month of May 2024, 100 REG for free per wallet.&nbsp;<br>The objective of this distribution was to establish a first price level of REG.&nbsp;<br>2,061,500 REG were minted on this occasion and deposited in a <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xa99302f22f646c075413c69f2565fe69b5f5829a">Vault.</a><br>769,200 REG were claimed (37%), on the corresponding application, during the distribution month.&nbsp;<br>The price was set at just under $1.&nbsp;<br>This airdrop being taken from the DAO Treasury budget, the 1,298,600 unclaimed REG were transferred to the Treasury Safe wallet (10/23/2024).</p>
<h1>Purchase / Sale of REG</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With other tokens, via Liquidity Pools or YAM.</h3>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">The easiest way to buy or sell REG</mark>, at the best price on the pools, is to use the 1inch aggregator: &nbsp;<a href="https://app.1inch.io/#/100/advanced/swap/USDC/REG">https://app.1inch.io/#/100/advanced/swap/USDC/REG</a>.</p>
<p>Many liquidity pools with REG have been created, they are visible on applications like <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/pairs">Dextools</a> (search with the REG address: 0x0aa1e96d2a46ec6beb2923de1e61addf5f5f1dce).&nbsp;<br>The types of pool are very diverse (Honeyswap, Sushiswap, Balancer, Algebra, ..) and the exchange can be done with many tokens (USDC, WXDAI, RWA, BORG, EURe, ..)</p>
<p>To improve the liquidity of the REG, the DAO creates a pool on Sushiswap v3 (REG / USDC) with an endowment of 200 K REG, on several parity levels (RIP00003). The safe wallet that holds the liquidity is the following : <a href="https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x0212B941Cb5c80c9FcDA00035D126Ac067169E72#tokentxns">link</a><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With fiat currencies</h3>
<p>The purchase of REG, with fiat currencies, will soon be available via the services of <a href="https://www.mtpelerin.com">Mt Pelerin </a>(RIP00010).<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Value of REG</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:36.92%;"><img src="/imag-en/valeur_reg.png"></figure>
<p><br>The value of REG can be seen on apps like CoinGecko:<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/realtoken-ecosystem-governance"> link</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/fr/pi%C3%A8ces/realtoken-ecosystem-governance">https://www.coingecko.com/fr/pi%C3%A8ces/realtoken-ecosystem-governance</a><br><br>The value of the REG appreciated after the presentation of the first version of the governance tools (October 2024).<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>DAO Treasury</h1>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:24.46%;"><img src="/imag-en/treso_dao.png"></figure>
<p><br>The DAO Treasury Safe Wallet is as follows :<a href="https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0x3f2d192F64020dA31D44289d62DB82adE6ABee6c"> link</a></p>
<p>It contains (currently) three types of token: REG and the two RMM deposit tokens (USDC and WXDAI)&nbsp;<br><br>The balance (as of 12/31/2024) visible in the image, includes the following main movements:<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>REG</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The allocation, provided in the whitepaper for the DAO Treasury is 51.6 million REG.<ul>
      <li>After the Genesis airdrop, 1.299 million REG (unclaimed) were transferred to the Treasury,</li>
      <li>The 49.539 million, remaining to be minted, were minted in October 2024.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On November 23:<ul>
      <li>1500 REG were distributed to three contributors, at the launch of governance alongside RealT (RIP00002),<ul>
          <li>200,000 REG were transferred to a SushiSwap pool (RIP00003).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The budget planned for the RealT team (50 million REG) was minted on December 31st on the Treasury safe. A vote of the DAO will soon have to validate the transfer of this budget to a contract (hourglass) which will release these REG in accordance with the whitepaper (one year of blocking, followed by a gradual release over 4 years).</li>
  <li>The total of these movements corresponds to the 100.636 million REG displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><br>RMM Deposit Token (armmV3..)</h3>
<p><br>RMM deposit tokens come from the revenue generated by RMM v3. RMM charges 10% fees on the interest on loans (in USDC and WXDAI). These fees are shared between: AAVE (the basis of the RMM application) for 20%; and the DAO for 80%.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:69.58%;"><img src="/imag-en/retraits_rmm.png"></figure>
<p>The DAO share is received on the Treasury in RMM deposit tokens (so they grow, as long as they are not converted to stablecoin).&nbsp;<br><br>In 2024, they were collected (from RMM to the Treasury) twice in October and December.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two complementary movements took place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On November 8, armmv3USDC were converted into USDC to supply the 6000 USDC of the first incentive epoch (RIP00001).</li>
  <li>On November 15, the amount that had been collected (and which grew) by a first preDAO initiative in 2022 (SGOV) was paid into the DAO treasury.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount displayed above for each of the two RMM deposit tokens includes the interest related to the deposits.</p>
<h1>Marketing Budget</h1>

<p>The management of this allocation is under the sole responsibility of RealT.</p>
<p>The corresponding 17.5 million REG were minted on June 22, 2024.</p>
<p>A single expenditure of 500 REG was made, on July 15, for the Zealy marketing campaign. The end of 2024 campaign (donation of one REG per Realtoken purchased between December 18 and 25) will be taken from this budget and collected in January 2024.</p>
