## Introduction to Sablier.com

#### **⭐ For beginners**

Sablier.com is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows you to manage continuous payment flows on the blockchain. Imagine a faucet that pours money drop by drop, in real time, into a reserve that you can draw on at any time.
Sablier does exactly that, distribute a token in real time from one address to another address.
This solution facilitates recurring payments, such as salaries, subsidies or rewards.

#### **⭐⭐ For initiated**

Sablier uses smart contracts to create continuous payment flows, where tokens are unlocked progressively over time, to the nearest second.
Sablier includes two main protocols:
- Lockup: for flows, whose total amount is blocked from the start for a certain duration. The frequency of payments can be very varied.
Use cases: vesting and airdrops
- Flow: for flows, without initial deposit or duration at the origin.
Use cases: salaries, subsidies, etc.

The payment flow is continuously allocated to an NFT, owned by the beneficiary of the payments. The amount accumulated in the NFT can be withdrawn at any time.
This NFT can be transferable, or even used as collateral.

#### **⭐⭐⭐ For experts**

Sablier is based on smart contracts deployed on multiple blockchains, using token distribution protocols to manage payment flows/token distribution. Flows are created by locking tokens in a smart contract, which then releases the funds continuously at a predefined rate.

Key features are: Representation of flows by ERC-721 NFTs; Bulk flow creation; Compatibility with multisig like Safe; Permissionless and decentralized system.
Sablier provides a [web interface](https://app.sablier.com/) to easily interact with protocols.
Developers can integrate Sablier into their applications via APIs and integration templates available in the [official documentation](https://docs.sablier.com/). Payment flows can be monitored and analyzed using subgraphs and off-chain indexers, providing full visibility into transactions.

## Why the DAO could use Sablier.com

#### **⭐ For beginners**

The DAO could use Sablier to manage payments more efficiently and transparently. For example, DAO partners could receive their rewards or salaries in real time, simplifying financial management and ensuring full transparency.
The DAO could also distribute rewards, the availability of which would be progressive.

#### **⭐⭐ For initiated**

The DAO's use of Sablier would allow:

1. **Optimize treasury management**: By using continuous payment streams, the DAO can better manage its liquidity and avoid large payments that can disrupt treasury.

2. **Improve transparency**: All payments are recorded on the blockchain, allowing all DAO members to see how funds are distributed.

3. **Facilitate recurring payments**: Payments of salaries, grants or rewards can be automated, reducing administrative burden.

The first use case of the DAO is the distribution of REG from the budget dedicated to the RealT team. A vote on Tally will trigger the transfer of the Treasury budget to the Sablier, which will be initialized for the benefit of RealT with the payment frequency that has been voted.

#### **⭐⭐⭐ For Experts**

For the DAO, integrating Sablier would enable granular cash flow management through customizable smart contracts. Developers can leverage integration templates and locking contracts to create tailor-made solutions tailored to the DAO’s specific needs. Additionally, the use of subgraphs allows for in-depth analysis of payment flows, facilitating real-time data-driven decision-making. Risks associated with using Sablier are minimized through regular security audits and an active community of developers and users.

## Conclusion

Integrating Sablier.com into the RealToken DAO ecosystem could bring significant benefits in terms of financial management and transparency. By adopting this technology, the DAO could not only improve its operational efficiency, but also build trust among its members through transparent and automated payment management.
Sablier is completely free to use: other than the blockchain gas costs, there are no fees.
